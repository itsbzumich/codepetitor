    <h1>Dear Parents and Instructor </h1>
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">
      Thank you for trusting and using my product. I’m extremely grateful for your business. I would like to take this
      time to tell my
      story. In the process, I will explain why I think it’s so important that your kids start learning competitive
      programming as soon as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">
      Like many of you guys, my parents cared a lot about my math abilities, giving me tons of extra
      problems to do outside of regular school hours. I was always pretty good at math, yet, I always knew that there
      would be a time when I would have to expand into other fields, such as coding. For me, my start in coding was
      competitive coding, as it was the
      easiest way to transition for me. However, it wasn’t easy. Making the switch at 15 years old, I struggled with the
      resources provided. A lot of the resources weren’t tailored for people like me, who didn’t know how to code and
      were extremely new to the field of CS. Yet, I persevered and eventually had a moderately successful competitive
      coding experience.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">
      Today, I recognize the benefits of competitive coding. As a computer science major at the University of Michigan,
      my background in competitive coding is much more than just helping with college applications. Let's look at some
      other benefits. Before we do this, I'm not going to understate how useful this is for college applications. It's
      an extremely impressive extracurricular that can greatly boost one's chances of admission.

    <h1>Success in Courses </h1>
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">
      Having a background in competitive coding helps one understand computer science concepts and makes course content
      a lot more learnable and interesting. With such a rigorous curriculum with little margin of error, such a benefit
      makes a huge difference. Your kid will be able to master the content, earn amazing grades, and feel confident
      leading
      into more challenging courses. Furthermore, the critical thinking, problem solving, and coding skills they will
      gain throughout competitive coding will expand beyond just computer science courses into any math, engineering,
      and even non-STEM classes.

    <h1>Resume/Opportunities</h1>
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">
      Participating in competitive coding brings in a lot of opportunities for them to build their resume. Adding
      one's accomplishments within this field will allow them to stand out from the rest of the crowd. Furthermore, they
      will have more
      confidence to take advantage of other opportunities such as clubs, research, and projects. Success in this area of
      CS will
      allow for success in so many other endeavours within the field.

    <h1>Interviews</h1>
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">
      Now the job offers will start coming in left and right! But first, you must pass a coding interview! Thankfully,
      there's a large intersection between coding interviews and competitive coding. You will ace every interview easily
      if you develop a strong foundation in competitive coding. This applies to almost any software engineering
      position, but also to positions in academia and more! </p>

    <h1 style="margin:100px">Conclusion</h1>
    <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;margin:100px;">
      That’s why I made CODEPETITOR. I believe that competitive coding shouldn’t be intimidating. It should be something
      that should be introduced to talented youth as soon as possible, especially if they’re interested in STEM and
      TECH. One of my biggest regrets was not learning to code early enough. I felt like if I started during middle
      school, I would not only have more success in the field of competitive coding but also have been able to expand my
      interest in computer science beyond just problem-solving. I hope if you have the same goals for your kids, you
      won’t make my mistake and get them started as soon as possible. After completing this intro-level course, make
      sure your student continues to preserve. Continue to learn how to code, continue to problem solve, and continue to
      compete. I will provide resources at the end that will help guide you and
      your kid through the next steps. Please look for this link at the bottom of the home page.
